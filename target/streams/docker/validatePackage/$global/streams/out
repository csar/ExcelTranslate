[warn] [1] sbt-native-packager wasn't able to identify the docker version. Some features may not be enabled
[warn] sbt-native packager tries to parse the `docker version` output. This can fail if
[warn] 
[warn]   - the output has changed:
[warn]     $ docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'
[warn] 
[warn]   - no `docker` executable is available
[warn]     $ which docker
[warn] 
[warn]   - you have not the required privileges to run `docker`
[warn] 
[warn] You can display the parsed docker version in the sbt console with:
[warn] 
[warn]   sbt:your-project> show dockerVersion
[warn] 
[warn] As a last resort you could hard code the docker version, but it's not recommended!!
[warn] 
[warn]   import com.typesafe.sbt.packager.docker.DockerVersion
[warn]   dockerVersion := Some(DockerVersion(18, 9, 0, Some("ce"))
[warn]           
[success] All package validations passed
